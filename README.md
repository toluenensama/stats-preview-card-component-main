## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- TailwindCSS Flexbox
- TailwindCSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)



### What I learned
In this project, I used Tailwindcss CLI which is used as a node.js module. The module was install by using the following command.

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
```
The directory /src was creaated where the input.css and output.css files were stored. 
the input.css file is where I write my css and customize where neccesary.
In the input.css, I imported tailwindcss by using the command below. 
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```
On the terminal,The command below waas entered. To my understanding, the command executes the logic contained in the tailwindcss/cli package and takes the `./src/input.css` as input hence the flag `-i` and store the output in the `./src/output.css` hence the flag `-o`. Then it is commanded to watch for changes in both files, hence the `--watch` flag. 
```bash
  npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```
The output from this process is actually pure css generated by the tailwind package. This output file is then linked with the html file using

```html
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/output.css">
```

#### Design process
The card was centered by flexbox and the in-card layout was a grid layout. The color overlay waas done using the following html markup
```html
        <picture class="rounded-t-lg relative overflow-hidden lg:order-last lg:rounded-r-lg lg:rounded-l-none object-cover">
          <source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="/images/image-header-desktop.jpg">
          <img src="/images/image-header-mobile.jpg" alt="" srcset="" class="w-full h-full lg:h-full lg:w-full rounded-t-lg object-cover bg-soft-violet">
          <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-soft-violet opacity-70"></div>
        </picture>
```
The color overlay was introduced as a div container with the color as its background. Although, it was an empty container, the inset propert was set to 0 and the opacity to 70 to make it a bit transparent.
